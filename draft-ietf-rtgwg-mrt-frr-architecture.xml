   <abstract>

<t>This document defines the architecture for IP/LDP Fast-Reroute using 
Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT-FRR). MRT-FRR is a technology that gives 
link-protection and node-protection with 100% coverage in any network 
topology that is still connected after the failure.</t> 

   </abstract>
 </front>

 <middle>
   <section title="Introduction">
     
<t>This document describes a solution for IP/LDP fast-reroute <xref 
target="RFC5714"/>. MRT-FRR creates two alternate forwarding trees which
 are distinct from 
the primary next-hop forwarding used during stable operation. These two 
trees are maximally diverse from each other, providing link and node 
protection for 100% of paths and failures as long as the failure does 
not cut the network into multiple pieces. This document defines the 
architecture for IP/LDP fast-reroute with MRT.
</t>

<t> <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/> describes how 
to compute maximally redundant trees using a specific algorithm, 
the MRT Lowpoint algorithm.  The MRT Lowpoint algorithm 
is used by a router that supports the Default MRT Profile, 
as specified in this document. </t> 

<t>IP/LDP Fast-Reroute with MRT (MRT-FRR) uses two maximally diverse 
forwarding topologies to provide alternates. A primary next-hop should 
be on only one of the diverse forwarding topologies; thus, the other can 
be used to provide an alternate. Once traffic has been moved to one of 
the MRTs by one point of local repair (PLR), that traffic is not subject to further repair 
actions by another PLR, even in the event of multiple simultaneous 
failures. Therefore, traffic repaired by MRT-FRR will not loop between 
different PLRs responding to different simultaneous failures. </t> 


<t> While MRT provides 100% protection for a single link or node 
failure, it may not protect traffic in the event of multiple 
simultaneous failures, nor does take into account Shared Risk Link 
Groups (SRLGs). Also, while the MRT Lowpoint algorithm is computationally 
efficient, it is also new. In order for MRT-FRR to function properly, 
all of the other nodes in the network that support MRT must correctly 
compute next-hops based on the same algorithm, and install the 
corresponding forwarding state. This is in contrast to other FRR methods 
where the calculation of backup paths generally involves repeated 
application of the simpler and widely-deployed SPF algorithm, and backup 
paths themselves re-use the forwarding state used for shortest path 
forwarding of normal traffic. <xref 
target="sec_OAM"/>  provides operational guidance related to verification 
of MRT forwarding paths.</t> 

<t>In addition to supporting IP and LDP unicast fast-reroute, the diverse 
forwarding topologies and guarantee of 100% coverage permit fast-reroute 
technology to be applied to multicast traffic as described in <xref 
target="I-D.atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch"/>.  However, the current document 
does not address the multicast applications of MRTs. </t> 

     
     <section title="Importance of 100% Coverage">

       <t>Fast-reroute is based upon the single failure assumption -
       that the time between single failures is long enough for a
       network to reconverge and start forwarding on the new shortest
       paths.  That does not imply that the network will only
       experience one failure or change.
       </t>
       
       <t>It is straightforward to analyze a particular network
       topology for coverage.  However, a real network does not always
       have the same topology.  For instance, maintenance events will
       take links or nodes out of use.  Simply costing out a link can
       have a significant effect on what LFAs are
       available. Similarly, after a single failure has happened, the
       topology is changed and its associated coverage.  Finally, many
       networks have new routers or links added and removed; each of
       those changes can have an effect on the coverage for
       topology-sensitive methods such as LFA and Remote LFA.  If
       fast-reroute is important for the network services provided,
       then a method that guarantees 100% coverage is important to
       accommodate natural network topology changes.
       </t>

       <t>When a network needs to use Ordered FIB<xref
       target="RFC6976"/> or Nearside Tunneling<xref
       target="RFC5715"/> as a micro-loop prevention
       mechanism <xref target="RFC5715"/>, then the whole IGP area needs to have
       alternates available.  This allows the micro-loop prevention
       mechanism, which requires slower network convergence, to take
       the necessary time without adversely impacting traffic.
       Without complete coverage, traffic to the unprotected
       destinations will be dropped for significantly longer than with
       current convergence - where routers individually converge as
       fast as possible. See <xref target="sec_micro_loop"/> for more
	   discussion of micro-loop prevention and MRTs.
       </t>

     </section>

     <section title="Partial Deployment and Backwards Compatibility">

       <t>MRT-FRR supports partial deployment. Routers advertise their
       ability to support MRT.  Inside the MRT-capable connected
       group of routers (referred to as an MRT Island), the MRTs are
       computed.  Alternates to destinations outside the MRT Island
       are computed and depend upon the existence of a loop-free
       neighbor of the MRT Island for that destination.  MRT Islands are
	   discussed in detail in <xref target="sec_island"/>, and partial
	   deployment is discussed in more detail in 
	   <xref target="sec_partial_deployment"/>.

   <section title="Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT)">

     <t>A pair of Maximally Redundant Trees is a pair of directed
     spanning trees that provides maximally disjoint paths towards
     their common root.  Only links or nodes whose failure would
     partition the network (i.e. cut-links and cut-vertices) are
     shared between the trees.  The MRT Lowpoint algorithm is given
     in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>.  This
     algorithm can be computed in O(e + n log n); it is less than
     three SPFs.  This document
     describes how the MRTs can be used and not how to compute
     them.</t>

     <t>MRT provides destination-based trees for each destination.
     Each router stores its normal primary next-hop(s) as well as
     MRT-Blue next-hop(s) and MRT-Red next-hop(s) toward each
     destination.  The alternate will be selected between the MRT-Blue
     and MRT-Red.</t>

     <t>The most important thing to understand about MRTs is that for
     each pair of destination-routed MRTs, there is a path from every
     node X to the destination D on the Blue MRT that is as disjoint
     as possible from the path on the Red MRT.</t>

     <t>For example, in <xref target="fig_example_2_connected"/>,
     there is a network graph that is 2-connected in (a) and
     associated MRTs in (b) and (c).  One can consider the paths from
     B to R; on the Blue MRT, the paths are B-&gt;F-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;R
     or B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;R.  On the Red MRT, the path is
     B-&gt;A-&gt;R.  These are clearly link and node-disjoint.  These
     MRTs are redundant trees because the paths are disjoint.</t>

      to have two link-disjoint or node-disjoint paths from G, I or J
      to R.  The MRTs given in (b) and (c) offer paths that are as

<section anchor="mrt_and_frr" title="Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT) and Fast-Reroute">

  <t>In normal IGP routing, each router has its shortest path tree (SPT)to
  all destinations.  From the perspective of a particular destination,
  D, this looks like a reverse SPT.  To use maximally redundant
  trees, in addition, each destination D has two MRTs associated with
  it; by convention these will be called the MRT-Blue and MRT-Red.
  MRT-FRR is realized by using multi-topology forwarding.  There is a
  MRT-Blue forwarding topology and a MRT-Red forwarding topology.</t>

  <t>Any IP/LDP fast-reroute technique beyond LFA requires an
  additional dataplane procedure, such as an additional forwarding
  mechanism.  The well-known options are multi-topology forwarding
  (used by MRT-FRR), tunneling (e.g. <xref
  target="RFC6981"/> or <xref
  target="RFC7490"/>), and per-interface forwarding
  (e.g. Loop-Free Failure Insensitive Routing in <xref
  target="EnyediThesis"/>).</t>

  <t>When there is a link or node failure affecting, but not
  partitioning, the network, each node will still have at least one
  path via one of the MRTs to reach the destination D.  For example,
  in <xref target="Non-2-connected_Network_Example"/>, C would
  normally forward traffic to R across the C&lt;-&gt;R link.  If that
  C&lt;-&gt;R link fails, then C could use the Blue MRT path
  C-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;R.</t>

  <t>As is always the case with fast-reroute technologies, forwarding
  does not change until a local failure is detected.  Packets are
  forwarded along the shortest path.  The appropriate alternate to use

  describes exactly how to determine whether the MRT-Blue next-hops or
  the MRT-Red next-hops should be the MRT alternate next-hops for a

  <t>MRT alternates are always available to use.  It is a local
  decision whether to use an MRT alternate, a Loop-Free Alternate or
  some other type of alternate.</t>

  <t>As described in <xref target="RFC5286"/>, when a worse failure
  than is anticipated happens, using LFAs that are not downstream
  neighbors can cause looping among alternates.  Section 1.1 of <xref

  causing a loop on node failure.  Even if a worse failure than
  anticipated happens, the use of MRT alternates will not cause
  looping.</t>

<section anchor="sec_uni_forwarding" title="Unicast Forwarding with MRT Fast-Reroute">

  <t> There are three possible types of routers involved in forwarding
  a packet along an MRT path.  At the MRT ingress router, the packet
  leaves the shortest path to the destination and follows an MRT path
  to the destination.  In a FRR application, the MRT ingress router is
  the PLR.  An MRT transit router takes a packet that arrives already
  associated with the particular MRT, and forwards it on that same
  MRT.  In some situations (to be discussed later), the packet will
  need to leave the MRT path and return to the shortest path.  This
  takes place at the MRT egress router.  The MRT ingress and egress
  functionality may depend on the underlying type of packet being
  forwarded (LDP or IP).  The MRT transit functionality is independent
  of the type of packet being forwarded.  We first consider several
  MRT transit forwarding mechanisms.  Then we look at how these
  forwarding mechanisms can be applied to carrying LDP and IP
  traffic.</t>

<section anchor="sec_mrt_forwarding_mechanisms" title="Introduction to MRT Forwarding Options">

  <t> The following options for MRT forwarding mechanisms are
  considered.</t>

<section title="MRT LDP labels">

  <t> We consider two options for the MRT forwarding mechanisms using
  MRT LDP labels.</t>

  <section anchor="sec_option_1a" title="Topology-scoped FEC encoded using a single label (Option 1A)">
    
    <t><xref target="RFC7307"/> provides a
    mechanism to distribute FEC-Label bindings scoped to a given
    MPLS topology (represented by MPLS MT-ID).  To use multi-topology LDP to
    create MRT forwarding topologies, we associate two MPLS MT-IDs with the
    MRT-Red and MRT-Blue forwarding topologies, in addition to the
    default shortest path forwarding topology with MT-ID=0.</t>

    <t> With this forwarding mechanism, a single label is distributed
    for each topology-scoped FEC.  For a given FEC in the default
    topology (call it default-FEC-A), two additional topology-scoped
    FECs would be created, corresponding to the Red and Blue MRT
    forwarding topologies (call them red-FEC-A and blue-FEC-A).  A
    router supporting this MRT transit forwarding mechanism advertises
    a different FEC-label binding for each of the three
    topology-scoped FECs.  When a packet is received with a label
    corresponding to red-FEC-A (for example), an MRT transit router
    will determine the next-hop for the MRT-Red forwarding topology
    for that FEC, swap the incoming label with the outgoing label
    corresponding to red-FEC-A learned from the MRT-Red next-hop
    router, and forward the packet. </t>

    <t>This forwarding mechanism has the useful property that the FEC
    associated with the packet is maintained in the labels at each hop
    along the MRT. We will take advantage of this property when
    specifying how to carry LDP traffic on MRT paths using
    multi-topology LDP labels.</t>

    <t>This approach is very simple for hardware to support. However,
    it reduces the label space for other uses, and it increases the
    memory needed to store the labels and the communication required
    by LDP to distribute FEC-label bindings. In general, this approach will
	also increase the time needed to install the FRR entries in the FIB 
	and hence the time needed before the next failure can be protected. </t>

    <t> This forwarding option uses the LDP signaling extensions
    described in <xref target="RFC7307"/>.
    The MRT-specific LDP extensions required to support this option
    will be described elsewhere.</t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="sec_option_1b" title="Topology and FEC encoded using a two label stack (Option 1B)">

    <t> With this forwarding mechanism, a two label stack is used to
    encode the topology and the FEC of the packet.  The top label
    (topology-id label) identifies the MRT forwarding topology, while
    the second label (FEC label) identifies the FEC.  The top label
    would be a new FEC type with two values corresponding to MRT Red
    and Blue topologies.  </t>

    <t> When an MRT transit router receives a packet with a
    topology-id label, the router pops the top label and uses that it
    to guide the next-hop selection in combination with the next label
    in the stack (the FEC label).  The router then swaps the FEC
    label, using the FEC-label bindings learned through normal LDP
    mechanisms.  The router then pushes the topology-id label for the
    next-hop.</t>

    <t>As with Option 1A, this forwarding mechanism also has the
    useful property that the FEC associated with the packet is
    maintained in the labels at each hop along the MRT.</t>

    <t>This forwarding mechanism has minimal usage of additional
    labels, memory and LDP communication.  It does increase the size
    of packets and the complexity of the required label operations and
    look-ups.</t>

    <t> This forwarding option is consistent with context-specific
    label spaces, as described in <xref target="RFC5331"/>.  However, the precise
    LDP behavior required to support this option for MRT has not been
    specified.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Compatibility of MRT LDP Label Options 1A and 1B">
  <t> MRT transit forwarding based on MRT LDP Label options 1A and 1B can 
coexist in the same network, with a packet being forwarded along a 
single MRT path using the single label of option 1A for some hops and 
the two label stack of option 1B for other hops. However, to simplify 
the process of MRT Island formation we require that all routers in the 
MRT Island support at least one common forwarding mechanism. As an example, the 
Default MRT Profile requires support for the MRT LDP Label Option 1A 
forwarding mechanism. This ensures that the routers in an MRT island 
supporting the Default MRT Profile will be able to establish MRT 
forwarding paths based on MRT LDP Label Option 1A. However, an 
implementation supporting Option 1A may also support Option 1B. If the 
scaling or performance characteristics for the two options differ in 
this implementation, then it may be desirable for a pair of adjacent 
routers to use Option 1B labels instead of the Option 1A labels. 
If those routers successfully negotiate the use of Option 1B labels, 
they are free to use them. This can occur without any of the other 
routers in the MRT Island being made aware of it. 
</t>

<t> Note that this document only defines the Default MRT Profile which
requires support for the MRT LDP Label Option 1A forwarding mechanism.
</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Required support for MRT LDP Label options">
    <t> If a router supports a profile that includes the MRT LDP Label
Option 1A for the MRT transit forwarding mechanism, then it MUST support 
option 1A, which encodes topology-scoped FECs using a single label. The 
router MAY also support option 1B. </t>

 <t> If a router supports a profile that includes the MRT LDP Label
Option 1B for the MRT transit forwarding mechanism, then it MUST support 
option 1B, which encodes the topology and FEC using a two label stack. 
The router MAY also support option 1A. </t> 

  </section>

</section>

<section anchor="sec_MRT_IP_tunnel" title="MRT IP tunnels (Options 2A and 2B)">
 <t> IP tunneling can also be used as an MRT transit forwarding 
mechanism. Each router supporting this MRT transit forwarding mechanism 
announces two additional loopback addresses and their associated MRT 
color. Those addresses are used as destination addresses for MRT-blue 
and MRT-red IP tunnels respectively. The special loopback addresses 
allow the transit nodes to identify the traffic as being forwarded along 
either the MRT-blue or MRT-red topology to reach the tunnel destination. 
For example, an MRT ingress router can cause a packet to be tunneled 
along the MRT-red path to router X by encapsulating the packet using 
the MRT-red loopback address advertised by router X. Upon receiving the 
packet, router X would remove the encapsulation header and forward the 
packet based on the original destination address.</t> 

  <t> Either IPv4 (option 2A) or IPv6 (option 2B) can be used as the
  tunneling mechanism.</t>

  <t>Note that the two forwarding mechanisms using LDP Label options
  do not require additional loopbacks per router, as is required by
  the IP tunneling mechanism. This is because LDP labels are used on a
  hop-by-hop basis to identify MRT-blue and MRT-red forwarding
  topologies.</t>
</section>

</section>

<section anchor="sec_ldp_uni_forward" title="Forwarding LDP Unicast Traffic over MRT Paths">

  <t>In the previous section, we examined several options for
  providing MRT transit forwarding functionality, which is independent
  of the type of traffic being carried.  We now look at the MRT
  ingress functionality, which will depend on the type of traffic
  being carried (IP or LDP). We start by considering LDP traffic. </t>

  <t>We also simplify the initial discussion by assuming that the
  network consists of a single IGP area, and that all routers in the
  network participate in MRT.  Other deployment scenarios that require
  MRT egress functionality are considered later in this document.</t>

  <t>In principle, it is possible to carry LDP traffic in MRT IP
  tunnels.  However, for LDP traffic, it is desirable to avoid
  tunneling.  Tunneling LDP traffic to a remote node requires
  knowledge of remote FEC-label bindings so that the LDP traffic can
  continue to be forwarded properly when it leaves the tunnel. This
  requires targeted LDP sessions which can add management complexity.
  As described below, the two MRT forwarding mechanisms that 
  use LDP labels do not require targeted LDP sessions.</t>
  
  <section title="Forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Label Option 1A">
    <t> The MRT LDP Label option 1A forwarding mechanism uses
    topology-scoped FECs encoded using a single label as described in
    section <xref target="sec_option_1a"/>.  When a PLR receives an
    LDP packet that needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT (for
    example), it does a label swap operation, replacing the usual LDP
    label for the FEC with the Red MRT label for that FEC received
    from the next-hop router in the Red MRT computed by the PLR.  When
    the next-hop router in the Red MRT receives the packet with the
    Red MRT label for the FEC, the MRT transit forwarding
    functionality continues as described in <xref
    target="sec_option_1a"/>.  In this way the original FEC associated
    with the packet is maintained at each hop along the MRT. </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Label Option 1B">
    <t>The MRT LDP Label option 1B forwarding mechanism encodes the
    topology and the FEC using a two label stack as described in <xref
    target="sec_option_1b"/>.  When a PLR receives an LDP packet that
    needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT, it first does a normal LDP
    label swap operation, replacing the incoming normal LDP label
    associated with a given FEC with the outgoing normal LDP label for
    that FEC learned from the next-hop on the Red MRT.  In addition,
    the PLR pushes the topology-identification label associated with
    the Red MRT, and forward the packet to the appropriate next-hop on
    the Red MRT.  When the next-hop router in the Red MRT receives the
    packet with the Red MRT label for the FEC, the MRT transit
    forwarding functionality continues as described in <xref
    target="sec_option_1b"/>.  As with option 1A, the original FEC
    associated with the packet is maintained at each hop along the
    MRT.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Other considerations for forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Labels ">
 <t> Note that forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Labels can be done 
without the use of targeted LDP sessions when an MRT path to the 
destination FEC is used. The alternates selected in <xref 
target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/> use the MRT path to the 
destination FEC, so targeted LDP sessions are not needed. If instead one 
found it desirable to have the PLR use an MRT to reach the primary 
next-next-hop for the FEC, and then continue forwarding the LDP packet 
along the shortest path tree from the primary next-next-hop, this would 
require tunneling to the primary next-next-hop and a targeted LDP 
session for the PLR to learn the FEC-label binding for primary 
next-next-hop to correctly forward the packet.</t> 
  </section>

<section title="Required support for LDP traffic ">
    <t>For greatest hardware compatibility, routers implementing MRT
    fast-reroute of LDP traffic MUST support Option 1A of encoding the
    MT-ID in the labels (See <xref target="sec_proto_ldp"/>). </t>
</section>
  
</section>

<section title="Forwarding IP Unicast Traffic over MRT Paths">
 <t> For IPv4 traffic, there is no currently practical alternative 
except tunneling to gain the bits needed to indicate the MRT-Blue or 
MRT-Red forwarding topology. For IPv6 traffic, in principle one could 
define bits in the IPv6 options header to indicate the MRT-Blue or 
MRT-Red forwarding topology. However, in this document, we have chosen 
not to define a solution that would work for IPv6 traffic but not for 
IPv4 traffic.</t> 




  <t>The choice of tunnel egress is
  flexible since any router closer to the destination than the
  next-hop can work.  This architecture assumes that the original
  destination in the area is selected (see <xref
  target="sec_multi_homed_prefixes"/> for handling of multi-homed
  prefixes); another possible choice is the next-next-hop towards the
  destination.  As discussed in the previous section, for LDP traffic,
  using the MRT to the original destination simplifies MRT-FRR by
  avoiding the need for targeted LDP sessions to the next-next-hop.
  For IP, that consideration doesn't apply.</t>

  <t>Some situations require tunneling IP traffic along an MRT to a
  tunnel endpoint that is not the destination of the IP traffic.
  These situations will be discussed in detail later.  We note here
  that an IP packet with a destination in a different IGP area/level
  from the PLR should be tunneled on the MRT to the ABR/LBR on the
  shortest path to the destination.  For a destination outside of the
  PLR's MRT Island, the packet should be tunneled on the MRT to a
  non-proxy-node immediately before the named proxy-node on that
  particular color MRT.
  </t> 

  <section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT LDP Labels">
    <t>An IP packet can be tunneled along an MRT path by pushing the
    appropriate MRT LDP label(s).  Tunneling using LDP labels, as
    opposed to IP headers, has the the advantage that more installed
    routers can do line-rate encapsulation and decapsulation using LDP
    than using IP.  Also, no additional IP addresses would need to be
    allocated or signaled.</t>

    <section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT LDP Label Option 1A">
      <t>The MRT LDP Label option 1A forwarding mechanism uses
      topology-scoped FECs encoded using a single label as described
      in section <xref target="sec_option_1a"/>.  When a PLR receives
      an IP packet that needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT to a
      particular tunnel endpoint, it does a label push operation.  The
      label pushed is the Red MRT label for a FEC originated by the
      tunnel endpoint, learned from the next-hop on the Red MRT.
      </t> 
    </section>

    <section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT LDP Label Option 1B">
      <t>The MRT LDP Label option 1B forwarding mechanism encodes the
      topology and the FEC using a two label stack as described in
      <xref target="sec_option_1b"/>.  When a PLR receives an IP
      packet that needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT to a particular
      tunnel endpoint, the PLR pushes two labels on the IP packet.
      The first (inner) label is the normal LDP label learned from the
      next-hop on the Red MRT, associated with a FEC originated by the
      tunnel endpoint.  The second (outer) label is the
      topology-identification label associated with the Red MRT.
      </t>

      <t>  For completeness, we note here a potential variation that uses
	  a single label as opposed to two labels.  In order to tunnel  
      an IP packet over an MRT to the destination of the IP packet (as opposed
      to an arbitrary tunnel endpoint), then we could just push a 
      topology-identification label directly onto the packet.  An MRT transit 
      router would need to pop the topology-id label, do an IP route lookup 
      in the context of that topology-id , and push the topology-id label.

  <section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT IP Tunnels">

<section anchor="sec_island" title="MRT Island Formation">

  <t> The purpose of communicating support for MRT is to
  indicate that the MRT-Blue and MRT-Red forwarding topologies are
  created for transit traffic.  The MRT architecture allows for
  different, potentially incompatible options.  In order to create
  consistent MRT forwarding topologies, the routers participating in
  a particular MRT Island need to use the same set of options.  These
  options are grouped into MRT profiles.  In addition, the routers in
  an MRT Island all need to use the same set of nodes and links within
  the Island when computing the MRT forwarding topologies.  This
  section describes the information used by a router to determine the
  nodes and links to include in a particular MRT Island.  Some information
  already exists in the IGPs and can be used by MRT
  in Island formation, subject to the interpretation defined here.
  </t>
  
 <t>Other information needs to be communicated between routers for which 
there do not currently exist protocol extensions. This new information 
needs to be shared among all routers in an IGP area, so defining 
extensions to existing IGPs to carry this information makes sense. These 
new protocol extensions will be defined elsewhere. 
</t> 

  <t> Deployment scenarios using multi-topology OSPF or IS-IS, or
  running both IS-IS and OSPF on the same routers is out of scope for
  this specification.  As with LFA, it is expected that OSPF Virtual
  Links will not be supported.</t>


<t> At a high level, an MRT Island is defined as the set of routers 
supporting the same MRT profile, in the same IGP area/level and the 
bi-directional links interconnecting those routers. More detailed 
descriptions of these criteria are given below. </t> 

  <section title="IGP Area or Level">
    <t> All links in an MRT Island are bidirectional and belong to
    the same IGP area or level.  For IS-IS, a link belonging to both
    level 1 and level 2 would qualify to be in multiple MRT Islands.
    A given ABR or LBR can belong to multiple MRT Islands,
    corresponding to the areas or levels in which it participates.
    Inter-area forwarding behavior is discussed in <xref
    target="sec_abr_forwarding"/>.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Support for a specific MRT profile">
 <t> All routers in an MRT Island support the same MRT profile. A 
router advertises support for a given MRT profile using an 8-bit MRT 
Profile ID value. The registry for the MRT Profile ID is defined in this 
document. The protocol extensions for advertising the MRT Profile ID 
value will be defined elsewhere. A given router can support multiple MRT 
profiles and participate in multiple MRT Islands. The options that make 
up an MRT profile, as well as the default MRT profile, are defined in 
<xref target="sec_mrt_profile"/>. </t> 

<t>The process of MRT Island formation takes place independently 
for each MRT profile advertised by a given router. For example, consider 
a network with 40 connected routers in the same area advertising support 
for MRT Profile A and MRT Profile B. Two distinct MRT Islands will be 
formed corresponding to Profile A and Profile B, with each island 
containing all 40 routers. A complete set of maximally redundant trees 
will be computed for each island following the rules defined for each 
profile. If we add a third MRT Profile to this example, with Profile C 
being advertised by a connected subset of 30 routers, there will be a 
third MRT Island formed corresponding to those 30 routers, and a third 
set of maximally redundant trees will be computed. In this example, 
40 routers would compute and install two sets of MRT transit forwarding 
entries corresponding to Profiles A and B, while 30 routers would 
compute and install three sets of MRT transit forwarding 
entries corresponding to Profiles A, B, and C.</t> 

  </section>

  <section title="Excluding additional routers and interfaces from the MRT Island">
    <t> MRT takes into account existing IGP mechanisms for
    discouraging traffic from using particular links and routers, and
    it introduces an MRT-specific exclusion mechanism for links.
    </t>

    <section title="Existing IGP exclusion mechanisms">
      <t> Mechanisms for discouraging traffic from using particular
      links already exist in IS-IS and OSPF.  In IS-IS, an interface
      configured with a metric of 2^24-2 (0xFFFFFE) will only be used
      as a last resort.  (An interface configured with a metric of
      2^24-1 (0xFFFFFF) will not be advertised into the topology.)  In
      OSPF, an interface configured with a metric of 2^16-1 (0xFFFF)
      will only be used as a last resort.  These metrics can be
      configured manually to enforce administrative policy, or they
      can be set in an automated manner as with LDP IGP
      synchronization <xref target="RFC5443"/>.
      </t>

      <t> Mechanisms also already exist in IS-IS and OSPF to discourage 
	  or prevent transit
      traffic from using a particular router.  In IS-IS, the overload
      bit is prevents transit traffic from using a router.  
	  </t>
	  
	  <t> For OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, <xref target="RFC6987"/> specifies
      setting all outgoing interface metrics to 0xFFFF to discourage
	  transit traffic from using a router.( <xref target="RFC6987"/> 
	  defines the metric value 0xFFFF 
      as MaxLinkMetric, a fixed architectural value for OSPF.)
	  For OSPFv3, <xref target="RFC5340"/> specifies that a router be
	  excluded from the intra-area shortest path tree computation 
	  if the V6-bit or R-bit of the LSA options is not set in the Router LSA.

<section anchor= "sec_abr_forwarding" title="Inter-area Forwarding Behavior">

<t>An ABR/LBR has two forwarding roles.  First, it forwards traffic
within areas.  Second, it forwards traffic from one area into another.
These same two roles apply for MRT transit traffic.  Traffic on
MRT-Red or MRT-Blue destined inside the area needs to stay on MRT-Red
or MRT-Blue in that area.  However, it is desirable for traffic
leaving the area to also exit MRT-Red or MRT-Blue and return to
shortest path forwarding.</t>

<t>For unicast MRT-FRR, the need to stay on an MRT forwarding topology
terminates at the ABR/LBR whose best route is via a different
area/level.  It is highly desirable to go back to the default
forwarding topology when leaving an area/level.  There are three basic
reasons for this.  First, the default topology uses shortest paths;
the packet will thus take the shortest possible route to the
destination.  Second, this allows a single router failure that manifests
itself in multiple areas (as would be the case with an ABR/LBR failure)
to be separately identified and
repaired around.  Third, the packet can be fast-rerouted again, if
necessary, due to a second distinct failure in a different area.</t>

<t>In OSPF, an ABR that receives a packet on MRT-Red or MRT-Blue towards 
destination Z should continue to forward the packet along MRT-Red or 
MRT-Blue only if the best route to Z is in the same OSPF area as the 
interface that the packet was received on. Otherwise, the packet should 
be removed from MRT-Red or MRT-Blue and forwarded on the shortest-path 
default forwarding topology. To avoid per-interface forwarding state for 
MRT-Red and MRT-Blue, the ABR can arrange for packets destined to 
a different OSPF area to arrive at the ABR already not marked as MRT-Red or 
MRT-Blue. The Rainbow FEC mechanism can be used to achieve this, as 
described in the next section.</t> 

<t> The above description applies to OSPF. The same essential behavior 
also applies to IS-IS if one substitutes IS-IS level for OSPF area. 
However, the analogy with OSPF is not exact. An interface in OSPF can 
only be in one area, whereas an interface in IS-IS can be in both 
Level-1 and Level-2. Therefore, to avoid confusion and address this 
difference, we explicitly describe the behavior for IS-IS in <xref 
target="sec_inter_level_isis"/>. In the following sections only the OSPF 
terminology is used. </t> 

<section title="ABR Forwarding Behavior with MRT LDP Label Option 1A">

<t>For LDP forwarding where a single label specifies (MT-ID, FEC), the
ABR is responsible for advertising the proper label to each
neighbor.  Assume that an ABR has allocated three labels for a
particular destination; those labels are L_primary, L_blue, and L_red.
To those routers in the same area as the best route to the
destination, the ABR advertises the following FEC-label bindings:
L_primary for the default topology, L_blue for the MRT-Blue MT-ID and
L_red for the MRT-Red MT-ID, as expected.  However, to routers in
other areas, the ABR advertises the following FEC-label bindings:
L_primary for the default topology, and L_primary for the Rainbow MRT
MT-ID.  Associating L_primary with the Rainbow MRT MT-ID causes the
receiving routers to use L_primary for the MRT-Blue MT-ID and for the
MRT-Red MT-ID.</t>

<t>The ABR installs all next-hops for the best area: primary
next-hops for L_primary, MRT-Blue next-hops for L_blue, and MRT-Red
next-hops for L_red.  Because the ABR advertised (Rainbow MRT
MT-ID, FEC) with L_primary to neighbors not in the best area, packets
from those neighbors will arrive at the ABR with a label L_primary
and will be forwarded into the best area along the default topology.
By controlling what labels are advertised, the ABR can thus
enforce that packets exiting the area do so on the shortest-path
default topology.</t>

<section title="Motivation for Creating the Rainbow-FEC">
<t> The desired forwarding behavior could be achieved in the above
example without using the Rainbow-FEC. This could be done by having
the ABR advertise the following FEC-label bindings to neighbors
not in the best area: L1_primary for the default topology, L1_primary
for the MRT-Blue MT-ID, and L1_primary for the MRT-Red MT-ID.  Doing
this would require machinery to spoof the labels used in FEC-label
binding advertisements on a per-neighbor basis.  Such label-spoofing
machinery does not currently exist in most LDP implementations and
doesn't have other obvious uses.
</t>

<t>Many existing LDP implementations do however have the ability to
filter FEC-label binding advertisements on a per-neighbor basis. The
Rainbow-FEC allows us to re-use the existing per-neighbor FEC
filtering machinery to achieve the desired result.  By introducing the
Rainbow FEC, we can use per-neighbor FEC-filtering machinery to
advertise the FEC-label binding for the Rainbow-FEC (and filter those
for MRT-Blue and MRT-Red) to non-best-area neighbors of the ABR.</t>

<t> An ABR may choose to either advertise the Rainbow-FEC or 
advertise separate MRT-Blue and MRT-Red advertisements. This is a local choice.
A router that supports the MRT LDP Label Option 1A Forwarding Mechanism
MUST be able to receive and correctly interpret the Rainbow-FEC.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="ABR Forwarding Behavior with IP Tunneling (option 2)">

<t>If IP tunneling is used, then the ABR behavior is dependent
upon the outermost IP address.  If the outermost IP address is an MRT
loopback address of the ABR, then the packet is decapsulated and
forwarded based upon the inner IP address, which should go on the
default SPT topology.  If the outermost IP address is not an MRT
loopback address of the ABR, then the packet is simply forwarded
along the associated forwarding topology.  A PLR sending traffic to a
destination outside its local area/level will pick the MRT and use the
associated MRT loopback address of the selected ABR advertising
the lowest cost to the external destination.</t>

<t>Thus, for these two MRT Forwarding Mechanisms (MRT LDP Label 
option 1A and IP tunneling option 2), there is 
no need for additional computation or per-area forwarding state.</t>

</section>

<section title="ABR Forwarding Behavior with MRT LDP Label option 1B">
<t>The other MRT forwarding mechanism described in <xref
target="sec_uni_forwarding"/> uses two labels, a topology-id label,
and a FEC-label.  This mechanism would require that any router whose
MRT-Red or MRT-Blue next-hop is an ABR would need to determine
whether the ABR would forward the packet out of the area/level.
If so, then that router should pop off the topology-identification
label before forwarding the packet to the ABR.</t>

<t> For example, in <xref target="fig_abr_mrt"/>, if node H fails,
node E has to put traffic towards prefix p onto MRT-Red.  But since
node D knows that ABR1 will use a best route from another area, it is
safe for D to pop the Topology-Identification Label and just forward
the packet to ABR1 along the MRT-Red next-hop.  ABR1 will use the
shortest path in Area 10.</t>

<t>In all cases for IS-IS and most cases for OSPF, the penultimate
router can determine what decision the adjacent ABR will make.  The
one case where it can't be determined is when two ASBRs are in
different non-backbone areas attached to the same ABR, then the ASBR's
Area ID may be needed for tie-breaking (prefer the route with the
largest OPSF area ID) and the Area ID isn't announced as part of the
ASBR link-state advertisement (LSA).  In this one case, suboptimal
forwarding along the MRT in the other area would happen.  If that
becomes a realistic deployment scenario, protocol extensions could
be developed to address this issue.</t>

<section anchor="sec_multi_homed_prefixes" title="Prefixes Multiply Attached to the MRT Island">

<t>How a computing router S determines its local MRT Island for each
supported MRT profile is already discussed in <xref
target="sec_island"/>.</t>

<t>There are two types of prefixes or FECs that may be multiply
attached to an MRT Island.  The first type are multi-homed prefixes
that usually connect at a domain or protocol boundary.  The second
type represent routers that do not support the profile for the MRT
Island.  The key difference is whether the traffic, once out of the
MRT Island, might re-enter the MRT
Island if a loop-free exit point is not selected.</t>

<t>FRR using LFA has the useful property that it is able to protect
multi-homed prefixes against ABR failure. For instance, if a prefix
from the backbone is available via both ABR A and ABR B, if A fails,
then the traffic should be redirected to B. This can be accomplished
with MRT FRR as well.</t>

<t>If ASBR protection is desired, this has additional complexities if
the ASBRs are in different areas.  Similarly, protecting labeled BGP
traffic in the event of an ASBR failure has additional complexities
due to the per-ASBR label spaces involved.</t>

<t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC5286"/>, a multi-homed prefix
could be:
<list style="symbols">
<t>An out-of-area prefix announced by more than one ABR,</t>
<t>An AS-External route announced by 2 or more ASBRs,</t>
<t>A prefix with iBGP multipath to different ASBRs,</t>
<t>etc.</t>
</list>
See <xref target="sec_area_abstraction"/> for a discussion of a general issue
with multi-homed prefixes connected in two different areas.
</t>


<t>There are also two different approaches to protection.  The first
is tunnel endpoint selection where the PLR picks a router to tunnel to
where that router is loop-free with respect to the failure-point.
Conceptually, the set of candidate routers to provide LFAs expands to
all routers that can be reached via an MRT alternate, attached to the
prefix.</t>

<t>The second is to use a proxy-node, that can be named via MPLS label
or IP address, and pick the appropriate label or IP address to reach
it on either MRT-Blue or MRT-Red as appropriate to avoid the failure
point.  A proxy-node can represent a destination prefix that can be
attached to the MRT Island via at least two routers.  It is termed a
named proxy-node if there is a way that traffic can be encapsulated to
reach specifically that proxy-node; this could be because there is an
LDP FEC for the associated prefix or because MRT-Red and MRT-Blue IP
addresses are advertised (in an as-yet undefined fashion) for that
proxy-node.  Traffic to a named proxy-node may take a different path
than traffic to the attaching router; traffic is also explicitly
forwarded from the attaching router along a predetermined interface
towards the relevant prefixes.</t>

<t>For IP traffic, multi-homed prefixes can use tunnel endpoint
selection.  For IP traffic that is destined to a router outside the
MRT Island, if that router is the egress for a FEC advertised into the
MRT Island, then the named proxy-node approach can be used.</t>

<t>For LDP traffic, there is always a FEC advertised into the MRT
Island.  The named proxy-node approach should be used, unless the
computing router S knows the label for the FEC at the selected tunnel
endpoint.</t>

<t>If a FEC is advertised from outside the MRT Island into the MRT
Island and the forwarding mechanism specified in the profile includes
LDP, then the routers learning that FEC MUST also advertise labels for
(MRT-Red, FEC) and (MRT-Blue, FEC) to neighbors inside the MRT Island.
Any router receiving a FEC corresponding to a router outside the MRT
Island or to a multi-homed prefix MUST compute and install the transit
MRT-Blue and MRT-Red next-hops for that FEC.  The FEC-label bindings
for the topology-scoped FECs ((MT-ID 0, FEC), (MRT-Red, FEC), and
(MRT-Blue, FEC)) MUST also be provided via LDP to neighbors inside the
MRT Island.</t>

<section title="Protecting Multi-Homed Prefixes using Tunnel Endpoint Selection">

<t>Tunnel endpoint selection is a local matter for a router in the MRT
Island since it pertains to selecting and using an alternate and does
not affect the transit MRT-Red and MRT-Blue forwarding
topologies. </t>

<t>Let the computing router be S and the next-hop F be the node whose
failure is to be avoided.  Let the destination be prefix p.  Have A be
the router to which the prefix p is attached for S's shortest path to
p. </t>

<t>The candidates for tunnel endpoint selection are those to which the
destination prefix is attached in the area/level.  For a particular
candidate B, it is necessary to determine if B is loop-free to reach p
with respect to S and F for node-protection or at least with respect
to S and the link (S, F) for link-protection.  If B will always prefer
to send traffic to p via a different area/level, then this is
definitional.  Otherwise, distance-based computations are necessary
and an SPF from B's perspective may be necessary.  The following
equations give the checks needed; the rationale is similar to that
given in <xref target="RFC5286"/>.</t>

<t>Loop-Free for S:   D_opt(B, p) &lt; D_opt(B, S) + D_opt(S, p)</t>
<t>Loop-Free for F:   D_opt(B, p) &lt; D_opt(B, F) + D_opt(F, p)</t>

<t>The latter is equivalent to the following, which avoids the need to
compute the shortest path from F to p.</t>

<t>Loop-Free for F:   D_opt(B, p) &lt; D_opt(B, F) + D_opt(S, p) - D_opt(S, F)</t>

<t>Finally, the rules for Endpoint selection are given below.  The
basic idea is to repair to the prefix-advertising router selected for
the shortest-path and only to select and tunnel to a different
endpoint if necessary (e.g. A=F or F is a cut-vertex or the link (S,F)
is a cut-link).</t>

<t><list style="numbers">

<t>Does S have a node-protecting alternate to A?  If so, select that.
Tunnel the packet to A along that alternate. For example, if LDP is
the forwarding mechanism, then push the label (MRT-Red, A) or
(MRT-Blue, A) onto the packet. </t>

<t>If not, then is there a router B that is loop-free to reach p while
avoiding both F and S?  If so, select B as the end-point.  Determine
the MRT alternate to reach B while avoiding F.  Tunnel the packet to B
along that alternate.  For example, with LDP, push the label (MRT-Red,
B) or (MRT-Blue, B) onto the packet.</t>

<t>If not, then does S have a link-protecting alternate to A?  If so,
select that.</t>

<t>If not, then is there a router B that is loop-free to reach p while
avoiding S and the link from S to F?  If so, select B as the endpoint
and the MRT alternate for reaching B from S that avoid the link
(S,F).</t>
</list></t>

<t>The tunnel endpoint selected will receive a packet destined to
itself and, being the egress, will pop that MPLS label (or have
signaled Implicit Null) and forward based on what is underneath.  This
suffices for IP traffic since the tunnel endpoint can use the IP
header of the original packet to continue forwarding the packet.
However, tunnelling of LDP traffic requires targeted LDP
sessions for learning the FEC-label binding at the tunnel
endpoint.</t>

</section>

<section title="Protecting Multi-Homed Prefixes using Named Proxy-Nodes">

<t> Instead, the named proxy-node method works with LDP traffic
without the need for targeted LDP sessions.  It also has a clear
advantage over tunnel endpoint selection, in that it is possible to
explicitly forward from the MRT Island along an interface to a
loop-free island neighbor when that interface may not be a primary
next-hop.</t>

<t>A named proxy-node represents one or more destinations and, for LDP
forwarding, has a FEC associated with it that is signalled into the MRT
Island.  Therefore, it is possible to explicitly label packets to go
to (MRT-Red, FEC) or (MRT-Blue, FEC); at the border of the MRT Island,
the label will swap to meaning (MT-ID 0, FEC).  It would be possible
to have named proxy-nodes for IP forwarding, but this would require
extensions to signal two IP addresses to be associated with MRT-Red
and MRT-Blue for the proxy-node.  A named proxy-node can be uniquely
represented by the two routers in the MRT Island to which it is
connected.  The extensions to signal such IP addresses will be
defined elsewhere.  The details of what
label-bindings must be originated will be described in another document.</t>

<t>Computing the MRT next-hops to a named proxy-node and the MRT
alternate for the computing router S to avoid a particular failure
node F is straightforward.  The details of the simple constant-time
functions, Select_Proxy_Node_NHs() and Select_Alternates_Proxy_Node(),
are given in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>.  A key
point is that computing these MRT next-hops and alternates can be done
as new named proxy-nodes are added or removed without requiring a new
MRT computation or impacting other existing MRT paths.  This maps very
well to, for example, how OSPFv2 (see <xref target="RFC2328"/> Section
16.5) does incremental updates for new summary-LSAs.</t>

<t>The remaining question is how to attach the named proxy-node to the MRT
Island; all the routers in the MRT Island MUST do this consistently.
No more than 2 routers in the MRT Island can be selected; one should
only be selected if there are no others that meet the necessary
criteria.  The named proxy-node is logically part of the
area/level.</t>

<t>There are two sources for candidate routers in the MRT Island to
connect to the named proxy-node.  The first set are those routers 
in the MRT Island that
are advertising the prefix; the named-proxy-cost assigned to each
prefix-advertising router is the announced cost to the prefix.  The
second set are those routers in the MRT Island that are connected to
routers not in the MRT Island but in the same area/level; such routers
will be defined as Island Border Routers (IBRs).  The routers
connected to the IBRs that are not in the MRT Island and are in the
same area/level as the MRT island are Island Neighbors(INs).</t>

<t>Since packets sent to the named proxy-node along MRT-Red or
MRT-Blue may come from any router inside the MRT Island, it is
necessary that whatever router to which an IBR forwards the packet be
loop-free with respect to the whole MRT Island for the destination.
Thus, an IBR is a candidate router only if it possesses at least one
IN whose shortest path to the prefix does not enter the MRT Island.  A
method for identifying loop-free Island Neighbors(LFINs) 
is given in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>.
The named-proxy-cost assigned to each (IBR, IN) pair is
cost(IBR, IN) + D_opt(IN, prefix).</t>

<t>From the set of prefix-advertising routers and the set of IBRs with
at least one LFIN, the two routers with the lowest named-proxy-cost
are selected.  Ties are broken based upon the lowest Router ID.  For
ease of discussion, the two selected routers will be referred to as
proxy-node attachment routers.</t>

<t>A proxy-node attachment router has a special forwarding role.  When
a packet is received destined to (MRT-Red, prefix) or (MRT-Blue,
prefix), if the proxy-node attachment router is an IBR, it MUST swap
to the shortest path forwarding topology (e.g. swap to the label for (MT-ID 0, prefix)
or remove the outer IP encapsulation) and forward the packet to the IN
whose cost was used in the selection.  If the proxy-node attachment
router is not an IBR, then the packet MUST be removed from the MRT
forwarding topology and sent along the interface(s) that caused the
router to advertise the prefix; this interface might be out of the
area/level/AS.</t>


</section>

<section title="MRT Alternates for Destinations Outside the MRT Island">

<t>A natural concern with new functionality is how to have it be
useful when it is not deployed across an entire IGP area.  In the case
of MRT FRR, where it provides alternates when appropriate LFAs aren't
available, there are also deployment scenarios where it may make sense
to only enable some routers in an area with MRT FRR.  A simple example
of such a scenario would be a ring of 6 or more routers that is
connected via two routers to the rest of the area.</t>

<t>Destinations inside the local island can obviously use MRT
alternates.  Destinations outside the local island can be treated like
a multi-homed prefix and either Endpoint Selection or Named
Proxy-Nodes can be used.  Named Proxy-Nodes MUST be supported when LDP
forwarding is supported and a label-binding for the destination is
sent to an IBR.</t>

<t>Naturally, there are more complicated options to improve coverage,
such as connecting multiple MRT islands across tunnels, but the need
for the additional complexity has not been justified.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Network Convergence and Preparing for the Next Failure">

<t>After a failure, MRT detours ensure that packets reach their
intended destination while the IGP has not reconverged onto the new
topology.  As link-state updates reach the routers, the IGP process
calculates the new shortest paths. Two things need attention:
micro-loop prevention and MRT re-calculation.</t>

<section anchor="sec_micro_loop" title="Micro-loop prevention and MRTs">

<t> A micro-loop is a transient packet forwarding loop among two or more 
routers that can occur during convergence of IGP forwarding state.
 <xref target="RFC5715"/> 
discusses several techniques for preventing micro-loops.   This section 
discusses how MRT-FRR relates to two of the micro-loop prevention 
techniques discussed in <xref target="RFC5715"/>, Nearside Tunneling
and Farside Tunneling.  </t> 

<t> In Nearside Tunneling, a router (PLR) adjacent to a failure perform 
local repair and inform remote routers of the failure. The remote 
routers initially tunnel affected traffic to the nearest PLR, using 
tunnels which are unaffected by the failure. Once the forwarding state 
for normal shortest path routing has converged, the remote routers 
return the traffic to shortest path forwarding. MRT-FRR is relevant for 
Nearside Tunneling for the following reason. The process of tunneling 
traffic to the PLRs and waiting a sufficient amount of time for IGP 
forwarding state convergence with Nearside Tunneling means that traffic 
will generally be relying on the local repair at the PLR for longer than 
it would in the absence of Nearside Tunneling. Since MRT-FRR provides 
100% coverage for single link and node failure, it may be an attractive 
option to provide the local repair paths when Nearside Tunneling is 
deployed. </t> 

<t> MRT-FRR is also relevant for the Farside Tunneling micro-loop 
prevention technique. In Farside Tunneling, remote routers tunnel 
traffic affected by a failure to a node downstream of the failure with 
respect to traffic destination. This node can be viewed as being on the 
farside of the failure with respect to the node initiating the tunnel. 
Note that the discussion of Farside Tunneling in <xref 
target="RFC5715"/> focuses on the case where the farside node is 
immediately adjacent to a failed link or node. However, the farside node 
may be any node downstream of the failure with respect to traffic 
destination, including the destination itself. The tunneling mechanism 
used to reach the farside node must be unaffected by the failure. The 
alternative forwarding paths created by MRT-FRR have the potential to be 
used to forward traffic from the remote routers upstream of the failure 
all the way to the destination. In the event of failure, either the 
MRT-Red or MRT-Blue path from the remote upstream router to the 
destination is guaranteed to avoid a link failure or inferred node 
failure.  The MRT forwarding paths are also guaranteed to 
not be subject to micro-loops because they are locked to the topology 
before the failure.</t> 

<t> We note that the computations in <xref 
target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/> address the case of a PLR 
adjacent to a failure determining which choice of MRT-Red or MRT-Blue 
will avoid a failed link or node. More computation may be required for 
an arbitrary remote upstream router to determine whether to choose 
MRT-Red or MRT-Blue for a given destination and failure.</t> 

</section>

<section anchor="sec_recalculation" title="MRT Recalculation for the Default MRT Profile">

<t>This section describes how the MRT recalculation SHOULD be performed for 
the Default MRT Profile. This is intended to support FRR applications. 
Other approaches are possible, but they are not specified in this 
document. </t> 

<t>When a failure event happens, traffic is put by the PLRs onto the
MRT topologies.  After that, each router recomputes its shortest path
tree (SPT) and moves traffic over to that.  Only after all the PLRs
have switched to using their SPTs and traffic has drained from the MRT
topologies should each router install the recomputed MRTs into the
FIBs.</t>

<t>At each router, therefore, the sequence is as follows:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Receive failure notification</t> 
<t>Recompute SPT.</t> 
<t>Install the new SPT in the FIB.</t> 
<t>If the network was stable before the failure occured, wait a
configured (or advertised) period for all routers to be using their SPTs
and traffic to drain from the MRTs.</t>
<t>Recompute MRTs.</t> 
<t>Install new MRTs in the FIB.</t> 
</list>
</t>

<t>While the recomputed MRTs are not installed in the FIB, protection
coverage is lowered.  Therefore, it is important to recalculate the
MRTs and install them quickly.</t>

<t> New protocol extensions for advertising the time needed to recompute 
shortest path routes and install them in the FIB will be defined 
elsewhere.</t>

<section anchor="sec_OAM" title="Operational Considerations">

<t> The following aspects of MRT-FRR are useful to consider 
when deploying the technology in different operational environments 
and network topologies.</t>

<section title="Verifying Forwarding on MRT Paths">
<t> The forwarding paths created by MRT-FRR are not used by normal 
(non-FRR) traffic. They are only used to carry FRR traffic for a short 
period of time after a failure has been detected. It is RECOMMENDED that 
an operator proactively monitor the MRT forwarding paths in order to be 
certain that the paths will be able to carry FRR traffic when needed. 
Therefore, an implementation SHOULD provide an operator with the ability 
to test MRT paths with OAM traffic. For example, when MRT paths are 
realized using LDP labels distributed for topology-scoped FECs, an 
implementation can use the MPLS ping and traceroute as defined in <xref 
target="RFC4379"/> and extended in <xref target="RFC7307"/> for 
topology-scoped FECs. </t>
</section> 



<section anchor="sec_traffic_on_backup_paths" title="Traffic Capacity on Backup Paths">
<t> During a fast-reroute event initiated by a PLR in response to a 
network failure, the flow of traffic in the network will generally not 
be identical to the flow of traffic after the IGP forwarding state has 
converged, taking the failure into account. Therefore, even if a network 
has been engineered to have enough capacity on the appropriate links to 
carry all traffic after the IGP has converged after the failure, the 
network may still not have enough capacity on the appropriate links to 
carry the flow of traffic during a fast-reroute event. This can result 
in more traffic loss during the fast-reroute event than might otherwise 
be expected.</t> 

<t> Note that there are two somewhat distinct aspects to this 
phenomenon. The first is that the path from the PLR to the destination 
during the fast-reroute event may be different from the path after the 
IGP converges. In this case, any traffic for the destination that 
reaches the PLR during the fast-reroute event will follow a different 
path from the PLR to the destination than will be followed after IGP 
convergence.</t> 

<t> The second aspect is that the amount of traffic arriving at the PLR 
for affected destinations during the fast-reroute event may be larger 
than the amount of traffic arriving at the PLR for affected destinations 
after IGP convergence. Immediately after a failure, any non-PLR routers 
that were sending traffic to the PLR before the failure will continue 
sending traffic to the PLR, and that traffic will be carried over backup 
paths from the PLR to the destinations. After IGP convergence, 
upstream non-PLR routers may direct some traffic away from the PLR.</t> 

<t> In order to reduce or eliminate the potential for transient traffic 
loss due to inadequate capacity during fast-reroute events, an operator 
can model the amount of traffic taking different paths during a 
fast-reroute event. If it is determined that there is not enough 
capacity to support a given fast-reroute event, the operator can address 
the issue either by augmenting capacity on certain links or modifying 
the backup paths themselves. </t> 

<t> The MRT Lowpoint algorithm produces a pair of diverse paths to each 
destination. These paths are generated by following the directed links 
on a common GADAG.  The decision process for constructing the GADAG in the 
MRT Lowpoint algorithm takes into account individual IGP link metrics.  At
any given node,  links are explored in order from lowest IGP metric to 
highest IGP metric.  Additionally, the process for constructing the MRT-Red 
and Blue trees uses SPF traversals of the GADAG.   Therefore, the IGP
link metric values affect the computed backup paths.  However, adjusting the 
IGP link metrics is not a generally applicable tool for modifying the 
MRT backup paths.  Achieving a desired set of MRT backup paths by adjusting
IGP metrics while at the same time maintaining the desired flow of traffic
along the shortest paths is not possible in general.  </t> 

<t> MRT-FRR allows an operator to exclude a link from the 
MRT Island, and thus the GADAG, by advertising it as MRT-Ineligible. 
Such a link will not be used on the MRT forwarding path for any 
destination. Advertising links as MRT-Ineligible is the main tool 
provided by MRT-FRR for keeping backup traffic off of lower bandwidth 
links during fast-reroute events. </t> 

<t> Note that all of the backup paths produced by the MRT Lowpoint 
algorithm are closely tied to the common GADAG computed as part of that 
algorithm. Therefore, it is generally not possible to modify a subset of 
paths without affecting other paths. This precludes more fine-grained 
modification of individual backup paths when using only paths computed 
by the MRT Lowpoint algorithm. </t> 

<t>However, it may be desirable to allow an operator to use MRT-FRR 
alternates together with alternates provided by other FRR technologies. 
A policy-based alternate selection process can allow an operator to 
select the best alternate from those provided by MRT and other FRR 
technologies. As a concrete example, it may be desirable to implement a 
policy where a downstream LFA (if it exists for a given failure mode and 
destination) is preferred over a given MRT alternate. This combination 
gives the operator the ability to affect where traffic flows during a 
fast-reroute event, while still producing backup paths that use no additional 
labels for LDP traffic and will not loop under multiple failures. This 
and other choices of alternate selection policy can be evaluated in the 
context of their effect on fast-reroute traffic flow and available 
capacity, as well as other deployment considerations. </t> 

<t> Note that future documents may define MRT profiles in addition to 
the default profile defined here. Different MRT profiles will generally 
produce alternate paths with different properties. An implementation may 
allow an operator to use different MRT profiles instead of or in 
addition to the default profile. </t> 

</section>

<section title="MRT IP Tunnel Loopback Address Management">
<t> As described in <xref target="sec_MRT_IP_tunnel"/>, 
if an implementation uses IP tunneling as the mechanism to 
realize MRT forwarding paths, each node must advertise an MRT-Red and 
an MRT-Blue loopback address.  These IP addresses must be unique within
the routing domain to the extent that they do not overlap with each other
or with any other routing table entries. It is expected that 
operators will use existing tools and processes for managing 
infrastructure IP addresses to manage these additional MRT-related 
loopback addresses.
</t> 
</section>

<section title="MRT-FRR in a Network with Degraded Connectivity">
<t> Ideally, routers is a service provider network using MRT-FRR will be 
initially deployed in a 2-connected topology, allowing MRT-FRR to find 
completely diverse paths to all destinations. However, a network can 
differ from an ideal 2-connected topology for many possible reasons, 
including network failures and planned maintenance events.</t> 

<t> MRT-FRR is designed to continue to function properly when network 
connectivity is degraded. When a network contains cut-vertices or 
cut-links dividing the network into different 2-connected blocks, 
MRT-FRR will continue to provide completely diverse paths for 
destinations within the same block as the PLR. For a destination in a 
different block from the PLR, the redundant paths created by MRT-FRR 
will be link and node diverse within each block, and the paths will only 
share links and nodes that are cut-links or cut-vertices in the 
topology. </t> 

<t> If a network becomes partitioned with one set of routers having no 
connectivity to another set of routers, MRT-FRR will function 
independently in each set of connected routers, providing redundant 
paths to destinations in same set of connected routers as a given 
PLR.</t> 

</section>

<section anchor="sec_partial_deployment" title="Partial Deployment of MRT-FRR in a Network">
<t> A network operator may choose to deploy MRT-FRR only on a subset of 
routers in an IGP area. MRT-FRR is designed to accommodate this partial 
deployment scenario. Only routers that advertise support for a given MRT 
profile will be included in a given MRT Island. For a PLR within the MRT 
Island, MRT-FRR will create redundant forwarding paths to all 
destinations with the MRT Island using maximally redundant trees all the 
way to those destinations. For destinations outside of the MRT Island, 
MRT-FRR creates paths to the destination which use forwarding state 
created by MRT-FRR within the MRT Island and shortest path forwarding 
state outside of the MRT Island. The paths created by MRT-FRR to 
non-Island destinations are guaranteed to be diverse within the MRT 
Island (if topologically possible). However, the part of the paths 
outside of the MRT Island may not be diverse.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>In general, MRT forwarding paths do not follow shortest paths. 
The transit forwarding state corresponding to the MRT paths is 
created during normal operations (before a failure occurs). Therefore, a 
malicious packet with an appropriate header injected into the network 
from a compromised location would be forwarded to a destination along a 
non-shortest path. When this technology is deployed, a network security 
design should not rely on assumptions about potentially malicious 
traffic only following shortest paths.</t> 

<t>It should be noted that the creation of non-shortest forwarding
paths is not unique to MRT.</t>

<t> MRT-FRR requires that routers advertise information used in the 
formation of MRT backup paths. While this document does not specify the 
protocol extensions used to advertise this information, we discuss 
security considerations related to the information itself. Injecting 
false MRT-related information could be used to direct some MRT backup 
paths over compromised transmission links. Combined with the ability to 
generate network failures, this could be used to send traffic over 
compromised transmission links during a fast-reroute event. In order to 
prevent this potential exploit, a receiving router needs to be able to
authenticate MRT-related information that claims to have been advertised by 
another router.</t>

<section anchor="sec_inter_level_isis" title="Inter-level Forwarding Behavior for IS-IS">
<t> In the description below, we use the terms "Level-1-only 
interface", "Level-2-only interface", and "Level-1-and-Level-2 
interface" to mean in interface which has formed only a Level-1 
adjacency, only a Level-2 adjacency, or both Level-1 and Level-2 
adjacencies. Note that IS-IS also defines the concept of areas. A router 
is configured with an IS-IS area identifier, and a given router may be 
configured with multiple IS-IS area identifiers. For an IS-IS Level-1 
adjacency to form between two routers, at least one IS-IS area 
identifier must match. IS-IS Level-2 adjacencies to not require any area 
identifiers to match. The behavior described below does not explicitly 
refer to IS-IS area identifiers. However, IS-IS area identifiers will indirectly 
affect the behavior by affecting the formation of Level-1 adjacencies. 
</t>

<t>First consider a packet destined to Z on MRT-Red or MRT-Blue received 
on a Level-1-only interface. If the best shortest path route to Z was 
learned from a Level-1 advertisement, then the packet should continue to 
be forwarded along MRT-Red or MRT-Blue. If instead the best route was 
learned from a Level-2 advertisement, then the packet should be removed 
from MRT-Red or MRT-Blue and forwarded on the shortest-path default 
forwarding topology. </t> 

<t>Now consider a packet destined to Z on MRT-Red or MRT-Blue received 
on a Level-2-only interface. If the best route to Z was learned from a
Level-2 advertisement, then the packet should continue to be forwarded 
along MRT-Red or MRT-Blue. If instead the best route was learned from 
a Level-1 advertisement, then the packet should be removed from MRT-Red 
or MRT-Blue and forwarded on the shortest-path default forwarding 
topology. </t> 

<t>Finally, consider a packet destined to Z on MRT-Red or MRT-Blue 
received on a Level-1-and-Level-2 interface. This packet should continue 
to be forwarded along MRT-Red or MRT-Blue, regardless of which level the
route was learned from. </t> 

<t> An implementation may simplify the decision-making process above by 
using the interface of the next-hop for the route to Z to determine the 
level that the best route to Z was learned from. If the next-hop points 
out a Level-1-only interface, then the route was learned from a Level-1 
advertisement. If the next-hop points out a Level-2-only interface, then 
the route was learned from a Level-2 advertisement. A next-hop that 
points out a Level-1-and-Level-2 interface does not provide enough 
information to determine the source of the best route. With this 
simplification, an implementation would need to continue forwarding 
along MRT-Red or MRT-Blue when the next-hop points out a 
Level-1-and-Level-2 interface. Therefore, a packet on MRT-Red or 
MRT-Blue going from Level-1 to Level-2 (or vice versa) that traverses a 
Level-1-and-Level-2 interface in the process will remain on MRT-Red or 
MRT-Blue. This simplification may not always produce the optimal 
forwarding behavior, but it does not introduce interoperability 
problems. The packet will stay on an MRT backup path longer than 
necessary, but it will still reach its destination. </t>

<t>Consider the network in <xref target="fig_mhp_areas"/> and assume
there is a richer connective topology that isn't shown, where the same
prefix is announced by ASBR X and ASBR Y which are in different
non-backbone areas.  If the link from A to ASBR X fails, then an MRT
alternate could forward the packet to ABR 1 and ABR 1 could forward it
to D, but then D would find the shortest route is back via ABR 1 to
Area 20.  This problem occurs because the routers, including the ABR,
in one area are not yet aware of the failure in a different area.</t>

<t>The only way to get it from A to ASBR Y is to explicitly tunnel it
to ASBR Y.  If the traffic is unlabeled or the appropriate MPLS labels
are known, then explicit tunneling MAY be used as long as the
shortest-path of the tunnel avoids the failure point.  In that case, A
must determine that it should use an explicit tunnel instead of an MRT
alternate.</t>
